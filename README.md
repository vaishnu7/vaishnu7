# Hi üëã I am Vaishnu and welcome to my Profile
 
## üîÆ Know about me
üìö _I am a PhD student in Engineering Mathematics at The University of Bristol funded by EPSRC DTP. I did Integrated MSc. in Mathematics and Computing from Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra and I also have PG Cert. in Mathematics from the University of Glasgow_

### üî≠ Work in progress
- Synthetic biology and control theory under the guidence of [Dr. Lucia Marucci](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/people/person/Lucia-Marucci-8de3a95c-6f5e-4c4a-9850-cba01fd70edd/)
- Mathematical Biology (Ecology in Particular) under the guidance of [Dr. Abhinav Tandon](https://www.bitmesra.ac.in/Display_My_Profile_00983KKj893L?id=CD3WOv7WRoFXr3v4l9lMVSNcOmmzRvtkzHO8m%252b37NHw%253d)

### üå± Learning:
- Cybergenetics
- Control theory
- Mathematical modeling
- Computational ODE/PDE

### üëØ Collaborate with me 
- Mainly Focusing on Mathematical Biology based Research Project (DM Me if you're interested or if you have any idea)
